#Rainbow House English Club - Los Angeles

#### Grand Opening! [link.](https://rocky-garden-94800.herokuapp.com/)

### General Description
Rainbow House English Club is a highly enriching language school with 5 locations in Beijing, China. The present website might form the basis for a future business proposition to open Rainbow's first North American location in Los Angeles. 

The "setting" for the website in its current form is the Los Angeles center's opening week, when prospective students would arrive at the site to learn more about what Rainbow has to offer, and sign up for a trial class.

The main page does three main things: displays pictures of the new center, gives some information on what Rainbow is all about, and allows a user to sign up for a free trial lesson.

Completing the signup form gives each user a login, and redirects them to a choice of classes. Choosing a class confirms which class the user has signed up for. 

### Technical Specifications
The website uses Rails as a main engine of organization to create, read, update, and delete data. This rails app runs on Ruby 2.2.3 . 

HTML and CSS were used to give the webpage structure or styling.

The author made use of the [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) framework to attempt responsive and classy styling.

The author also took advantage of [LayoutIt](http://www.layoutit.com) to create a bootsrap skeleton for the final webpage.

This project follows Rainbow House's excellent [professionally-designed website](http://www.rainbowhouseclub.com/) as a template for the present imitation.

### Installation and Startup
Because of bootstrap, users can visit the website on both desktop and mobile devices and the view will be responsive to either display.

### Problems

The main problem encountered is age-old: how to put a "store" in the best possible position to get a customer to purchase a good or service. At present, the website does not give the impression that the school is a well-established, well-capitalized institution likely to improve one's English skills. 

It is hoped that more features will make

### Next Steps

Many functionalities remain to be implemented. In the future:
* Users should be able to cancel a class they have signed up for; an action that would notify instructors automatically
* Users should be able to view and update payment information
* Users should be able to view feedback info, such as test results

Stylistically, the author would like to:
* Make the website mostly a one-page application. When users would click links, the page would scroll to the appropriate section
* Have picture carousels that slide gracefully
* Have images that slowly zoom in and out to give life to the app
* Eliminate some of the styling methods that make the website appear a bit "boxy" and unnatural in places
* Achieve a faster page load 

With respect to code, the author would like to:
* Achieve better separation of concerns by eliminating all inline styling.

### Thank You!

Numerous instructors, classmates, TAs, and anonymous denizens of the internet contributed advice that proved vital to the author's efforts.
